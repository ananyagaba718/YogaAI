# Yoga Pose Verification with CNN and LSTM

This project aims to help yoga practitioners improve their practice by providing real-time feedback on their poses using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The system recognizes and validates poses, ensuring proper alignment and sequence, all through a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Pose Recognition**: Uses CNNs to analyze and classify yoga poses, providing feedback on alignment.
- **Pose Sequence Tracking**: LSTMs track the flow of poses, ensuring smooth transitions and maintaining proper form.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Users receive immediate corrections to help adjust their poses during practice.
- **Simple GUI**: An intuitive graphical interface to upload images or video frames for pose analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **CNNs** for pose recognition and classification.
- **LSTMs** for sequence validation and ensuring correct pose transitions.
- **Python** for the implementation of the system.
- **Tkinter** (or similar) for building the GUI.

## How It Works

The system uses CNNs to analyze images of yoga poses, providing real-time feedback on their accuracy. LSTMs are used to track the sequence of poses, ensuring that transitions are smooth and that the practitioner maintains proper form throughout the routine. The interface is simple and intuitive, allowing users to upload their photos or videos and receive feedback instantly.

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time video tracking for live corrections.
- Support for more yoga poses and variations.
- Personalized feedback and progress tracking.
